## Project Description 
Project name: SCRTSybil

SCRTSybil is an oracle for credit score checks, designed for the [Secret Network](https://scrt.network/). The objective of SCRTSybil is to return a quantifiable, yet private and partially-encrypted credit score for SCRT network users allowing to categorize users by credibility and trustworthiness within the ecosystem. Credit checks will incentivize the activity of new, yet trusted and verified SCRT network users, while also affirming the reputation of long-standing users.

Users will need to authenticate themselves via their Ledger or Keplr wallet to access the SCRTSybil Web2 app for starting the scoring process. After completing the necessary steps their score is computed and sent to a smart contract generator which packages their score alongside some basic information that will be encrypted when being published to the network. Users then have their ‘profiles’ stored and accessible on SCRT for anyone to request their credit score by specifying their public address as an identifier/primary key which binds the user account to their score and related attributes of the score. Various key types will decrypt different pieces of information about the users depending on who the score requester is and whether the user endorses the access request.   
 
## Problem / Solution  
How can one validate the trustworthiness of blockchain users, while maintaining user privacy? Our project focuses on building a SCRT oracle, called SCRTSybil, for credit scoring, using Web2 apps for acquiring the data to calculate a score and Web3 (SCRT network) for storing, encrypting and making the score available to the world.  We will build TLS connections from on-chain validator enclaves to APIs, creating private credit check scores for secret contracts. These APIs will aggregate a user’s credit data from web3 (wallet balance and transaction history in one of at least 2 cryptocurrency exchange platforms where they have an account, e.g., Coinbase, Binance, etc.) with web2 data (bank account balance, credit history, recent activity, liquidity, etc. via Plaid). The credit check outcome will be quantified via a credit scoring algorithm which we will build based on an initially simple criteria. This algorithm integrates web2 and web3 validation of a user’s financial standing and history. Validated private data feed, i.e., the actual credit score will be stored on-chain and can be accessed via a privately issued SCRT key.

#### Components

1. **GUI**: user logs into SCRTSybil web application by authenticating with an existing wallet such as Keplr or Ledger. A user should therefore have a wallet + SCRT public address with some minimum balance (TBD) in order to proceed in calculating a credit score for themselves. Once logged into SCRTSybil, a user will be able to create a lightweight profile and view their account balance. The core purpose of the web app however is to provide users with a < 60 second experience, guided by a wizard, whereby they can authenticate with the SCRTSybil-integrated 3rd parties e.g. Plaid, which then computes their score. Their score (and historical scores will be stored in the web app (ReactJS)
 
2. **Restful API**: Python (Flask) + webhook framework with public APIs that can be used. The SCRTSybil API is the heartbeat through which data transfer is taking place both from interacting with 3rd party SDKs but also for passing on retrieved data to the credit scoring module. Note that the goal is not to store any sensitive data, but rather store the computed score and encrypted sources of data on SCRT.
 
3. **Credit Score Module**: credit score algorithm integrating at least these 5 weighted metrics. Metrics were adapted from the factors used by the three largest American consumer credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. 
Transaction History (txn counts + txn volume) 
Number and types of bank accounts/wallets owned
Ratio of used liquidity / available liquidity for each account
Length of account history
Recent (last 21 days) account activity
A machine learning module will be built with SciKit-Learn Python library + Flask for web framework. Output score on 300-900 non-linear numerical scale with associated qualitative scale: Excellent/Good/Fair/Below average/Poor.
 
4. **Smart Contract Compiler**: With the support of CosmWasm, this compiler will process statements written in Python and turn them into smart contracts in Rust. We see this as a potentially super reproducible open-source micro project to help bridge the gap for non-Rust developers in producing low-code smart contracts on SCRT.
 
5. **Node**: The node will be built on Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) + 120GB storage computer and managed in Dockerized environments with the hardware installed on-site. The node setup will all be open-sourced.
 
## Go-to-Market plan
We are building a credit scoring tool on SCRT as base-layer infrastructure for a series of use cases where individuals or businesses may verify potential customers for extending credit, P2P lending, or vetting a potential employee with financial background checks.
The go-to-market plan is two-fold:

1. Transaction fees & Request Fees. Users requesting to view a person’s credit score will need to be issued with a key to access that user’s smart contract stored on SCRT. This will require a fraction of SCRT as a transaction fee for exercising that key on the smart contract. For companies requesting scores for people, we can make the model comparable with the current $10 fee for an Equifax report in Canada.

2. Self-run credit scores. If an individual wants to know their own credit score and how they rank on the SCRT network in terms of ‘credibility’, we will charge a fee in SCRT (less than the fee to a score requester as above) for computing the score. This will be a fee that the user pays in-wallet to SCRTSybil, however, the score is not necessarily published as a smart contract. 

Our core goal is to initially provide tools for building financial ecosystems on SCRT as the network gains traffic and user adoption. We believe in the value of having a public network with the option and flexibility of data encryption and ultimately believe that mainstream tools for financial services like credit scores will be of the first major requirements for service providers on SCRT.  
 
## Value capture for Secret Network ecosystem
A credit check oracle is both a clear value proposition for existing SCRT holders and an incentive for new or prospective users. First, a SCRT credit check oracle will increase Secret Network usability by validating users’ reputation (measured in terms of credit check), and thus will create trust toward users who have been verified by the oracle. Secondly, the oracle promotes interoperability and accessibility for the Secret Network by connecting the chain to crypto exchange platforms. Lastly, SCRTSybil enriches the ecosystem by leveraging on the privacy-preserving smart contracts which are distinctive of the Secret network. We believe the community needs a credit check oracle as soon as possible. SCRTSybil aims to provide that.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

#### Why SCRT

1. **How did you hear about the SCRT Network Grants?** We heard through the Secret Network Webpage.

2. **Have you ever applied for other grants?** Yes, we have applied for another grant (TBD) to fund an entirely different project proposal for a different ecosystem. 

3. **Why did we apply for this grant?** We, at BalloonBox, are a team of engineers excited about the future of decentralized technologies, and we want to contribute to building it! We think that the SCRT network is rapidly and innovatively unlocking the full value of decentralized applications by leveraging the computational privacy of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and secret contracts to design Secret Apps preserving users’ privacy. We value the novelty of privacy-preserving smart contracts and their scalability potential which make SCRT a network that is uniquely set apart from other ecosystems. Specifically, we are submitting a proposal under the ‘‘Ecosystem’’ category because we want to build tools to expand the Secret Network and improve general usability. We hope our Credit Score Check to be the first of many such tools.  
 
 
#### Scope and Limitations
We will develop a simple WebApp for users to retrieve user credit scores. Although we aim to scale up the WebApp for numerous and diverse use cases in the near future, for this first initial grant we will limit the App to three UIs: (1) user login into Secret Network wallet via Ledger or Keplr; (2) enter user’s personal information; (3) choose your preferred web2/web3 validators and calculate your credit score. We mocked up three UI prototypes, one for each page respectively, to give you a clear idea of our vision. Please, find the UI prototypes [here](https://github.com/BalloonBox-Inc/SCRTnetwork_oracle/tree/main/UI%20prototypes).
Initially, the WebApp for the SCRTSybil Oracle will only allow user authentication to their Secret Network Wallet via Keplr or Ledger. In the future, this can scale to support a range of wallets supporting SCRT.
 
 
#### Future Plans

1. **Image processing** 
   - Integrate image processing for KYC authentication, e.g., interpreting passports, driving license, medical service cards, etc.


2. **Auxiliary & Novel Use Cases**

   Developing an oracle for credit score checks automatically satisfies this auxiliary use case:

    - personal information integrity validation: do the user’s first and last name match across different platforms (Coinbase, Binance, Plaid, etc.)?
   
   Furthermore, we’ve designed our oracle to easily scale up to use cases that we consider relevant to the Secret Network:
   
    - credit score check for Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
   
    - credit score check to support loan application for university/post-secondary education (in such case validators should include a diverse set of eLearning Platforms, e.g., Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Udacity, CloudAcademy, Udemy, DataCamp. An academic institution may want a credit score for a prospective student based on financial history but also academic history. For this use case, we could skew the algorithm weightings towards OAuth, where eLearning Platforms prove/disprove self-study courses.

    - third party (e.g., banks, financial institutions) request issuing of Secret private keys to validate user’s credibility 


3. **More Credit Check Providers**
   - Expand our validators pool (Coinbase, Binance, Stripe, Plaid) including more consolidated and emerging cryptocurrency exchanges (Kraken, crypto.com, Gemini, Bitstamp, MetaMask, etc.). For the moment, we will exclude decentralized exchanges like Bisq that do not require any KYC. We want to base our credit scoring algorithm to be anchored on platforms that validate the user identity.  


4. **Implement Credit Score Templates**
   - Imagine a third party requesting to issue a Secret private key to access a user’s credit score. Third parties may be Real and Personal Property Insurance Companies, Loan Agencies, Banks, Health Care Providers, and more. A bank will likely require a granular check on a user’s financial standing, while a Health Care Provider will require in-depth medical records for a patient. Similarly, an individual wanting to loan a friend money will value USD velocity in a US bank account far more than identity and this may require a credit model more skewed on historical throughput for a checking account. We want to design credit score templates with pre-set data granularities (i.e., more or fewer fields to be hashed out) depending on who is the third party requesting to access the credit score. In the long run, we envisage monetizing the smart contract generator to build credit score templates based on the needs of the third party. That is, the smart contract generator will serve as a template builder which we build privately for corporations or as community projects for user-level use cases.
